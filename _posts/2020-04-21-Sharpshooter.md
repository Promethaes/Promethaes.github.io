# Short Description
SharpshooterÂ is a quick little game where you have to get as much score as possible by hitting the yellow targets and managing your flight-time. Green walls will give you time when you bounce off of them, red will take time but give score, and pink will take all of your time.

# Post Mortem 
This project was super fun to make! It was my first Jam in a long time and I had a couple of friends helping with the game/level design. All of the code was written by me. I was super proud of how nice and extendable I felt the code was; when I was adding sounds to the game as a part of the patch I made a week later, it was extremely easy to pop the sounds in where I needed them! I focused on making use of Unity events in combination with managers.

I personally think that this is one of my best arcade style games that I've made, and while I didn't have an artist or sound designer (I made all the sounds myself) the game turned out pretty good!
