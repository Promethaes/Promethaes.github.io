# Short Description
Headless JEFF-3 is a second person perspective puzzle game featuring JEFF-3, a robot with a detached head. It features manipulation of perspective to create interesting gameplay.

# Post Mortem
Headless JEFF-3 was a very interesting project to work on for a multitude of reasons. I got to work with a whole new group of people on a team size that I've never experienced before, and the concept for the game was truly innovative! I worked on refactoring old code and creating AI with the use of a behaviour tree editor I made. I also had a hand in various systems when they needed fixing or implementing. I also loved to hang out and talk with the other contractors / main team and help them out with their work too.
