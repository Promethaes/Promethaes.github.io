# Short Description
This is a first person platformer/shooter that came to fruition after completing a prototype in a game jam. The game has a major focus on platforming and establishing a futuristic-cyberpunk-tokyo vibe.
# Post Mortem
This was the first project that gave me the chance to try and design my own blend of behaviour trees and FSM for AI. I had a lot of fun perfecting and refining the tools involved and making the enemy feel alive. I also helped add polish in a bunch of different places in the game and refined the systems that I worked on as much as I could given our time constraint.

I messed around with editor scripting and (since the guns are projectile) did some math to find out exactly where the bullet was going to end up based on the direction of the gun and the rotation of the "head". The aiming was also predictive and we ended up with a very accurate enemy, perhaps too accurate.
