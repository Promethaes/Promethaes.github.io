# Short Description
This prototype of Zero Possession is a snapshot into a new project I'm working on with Sedna Games, a studio that I helped to form. It's inspired by Mirror's Edge and Ghostrunner, and our main focus for the project is to provide a smooth first person shooter.
# Post Mortem
This jam was especially fun because I got to spend some time developing with my team. The last project we worked on ended up getting canceled in August of 2021, and we took a break up until this jam in December of the same year.

It always amazes me how much further we all push eachother and how our bar for quality raises with each iteration of our projects. The thing I'm most proud of in this jam was how quickly I was able to implement the systems I made. I was able to use several systems from other projects because of their modularity, with some modifications of course. I also learned how to use the Unity Animator, added some juice to the main menu and the combat systems, and learned more about particle systems!
