# Short Description
This game is very dear to my heart, as it was the first game I actually finished and released back in my first year of university. I got to show it off at our game convention for people to play, and it really made me feel like I made the right career choice.
 
Goldman's Saloon is a top down twin stick bullet hell where your goal is to get the highest score and beat Goldman. It's a simple little arcade game!
# Post Mortem
This project was actually done as a part of a month long game jam, but I had been working on it for months prior at that point. Actually, the point of the game jam was to finish an old project, and I was tired of not having this out there!
 
The project definitely still has some bugs, and because of the difficulty of testing local co-op right now, it's pretty much guaranteed to have problems. I still think it's a very fun solo experience though, I often see friends hooked for a while on it, and they always remark on how frustrating yet fun it is!
