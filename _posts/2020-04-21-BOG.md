​Beast Gévaudan is a tabletop game set in 16th century France. It aims to educate about PTSD and mental health while also being a fun role playing experience. I ported the game to Tabletop Simulator with the help of a well known community modder who taught me how to use the scripting API and also taught me the quirks of the applicaiton.

While this project was relatively simple, it took so long because I was working on my own time and I wanted to add juice to the digital version. The assets also frequently changed, along with some rules, forcing me to revise multiple times.

It was a very fun project to be a part of for sure! I got to work with multiple people internationally, I kind of felt out of my league at first. But the team was super kind and supportive, and they loved the end product that I made for them!
