Tone Fire is a wrapper for both FMOD Studio and Core API. I made it in a couple of days in December, because the lower years in my program were not taught how to put sounds into their games. As someone who is very passionate about music and sound in games, I could not allow their games to be silent! This was back in the days where the first and second year students of the program were forced to use C++ instead of using Unity, so that's why sound was an additional challenge for them.
