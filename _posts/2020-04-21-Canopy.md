# Short Description
Canopy is a tool that I decided to make because I was tired of working without visuals. I wanted to easily be able to create convincing AI without having to know where to look in the inspector. I also really wanted to learn how to make a tool with UI Builder and KiwiCoder happened to make a video on exactly what I needed!
# Post Mortem
As of this post, the tool is "complete" but I'm sure there will be many iterations needed in order to perfect it. I also need to do some light tutorialization on the repo's readme, and more feedback is always welcome. I was able to create a small navigation and perception system to go alongside the BT and Blackboard in order to test things out. I learned so much about UI builder and Unity's underlying tool making systems with this project and I can't wait to do more with those skills.
